			"desc":"Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. \n Change the scss below to use the variable",

			"title":"Nesting",
			"desc":"When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't. SASS will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice. Correctly nest the following css rules:",

			"title":"Partials",
			"desc":"You can create partial SASS files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other SASS files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a SASS file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets SASS know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. SASS partials are used with the @import directive. Correctly import the '_type' partial file:",
